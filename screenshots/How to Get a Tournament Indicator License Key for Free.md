Tournament Indicator is not just a simple poker calculator. It is a sophisticated poker software that combines the features of a poker HUD (heads-up display), a poker tracker, and a poker odds calculator. It shows you the mucked cards of your opponents, the pot odds, the outs, and the best hand at the current moment. It also tracks and analyzes your opponents' playing style, such as their aggression, preflop raise percentage, and showdown percentage. It helps you identify the fish, the sharks, and the tight players at the table.
 
Another unique feature of Tournament Indicator is the tournament MZone indicator. The MZone is a ratio of your stack to the blinds and antes and is used to determine how you should play when approaching the money in a tournament. Tournament Indicator shows you your MZone and your opponents' MZones at every stage of the tournament. It also gives you advice on how to adjust your strategy based on your MZone. For example, if you are in the green MZone, you can play more conservatively and wait for premium hands. If you are in the red MZone, you need to be more aggressive and look for opportunities to steal the blinds and antes.
 
With Tournament Indicator, you can improve your poker skills and increase your chances of winning. It is designed for both beginners and advanced players who want to take their game to the next level. It is also compatible with most online poker tournaments, such as sit and go, multi-table, satellite, shootout, turbo, and rebuy tournaments. Whether you play for fun or for money, Tournament Indicator can help you achieve your poker goals.
